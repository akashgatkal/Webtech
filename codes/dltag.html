            An equestrian statue of Peshwa Baji Rao I, Prime Minister of the Maratha Empire, in the Shaniwar Wada complex. 
            He was the first resident of the fortified palace.
            The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital building of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. 
            It was supposed to be made entirely of stone. However, after the completion of the base floor or the first story, the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Chhatrapati Shahu I (Emperor) saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the emperor himself and not the Peshwas.
